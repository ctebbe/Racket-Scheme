Due 11:55PM Wednesday, February 12. Use the dropbox on RamCT to turn in your assignment.
Name your file "a2.YourName.rkt".

The problems require that you write and test Racket/Scheme procedures (functions). These programs are to be written using recursion, without loops. Use of assignments is not allowed. However, you may use the Racket/Scheme "let" construct. You may also use helper functions. Develop a good set of test data, and make sure that your program runs on this data.

Submit your programs as one .rkt file (really a text file) to the RamCT dropbox. Name your file "a2.YourName.rkt". Put the assignment number, your name, and the date in a comment at the beginning of the file, as shown below for student Don Knuth:

; A2: Don Knuth 1/16/2014

Include the following honor pledge with your typed signature as a comment on your submitted assignment:

    "I have not given, received, or used any unauthorized assistance."
    - Your Typed "signature" 

Use the "Essentials of Programming Languages" version of DrRacket by including the following at the top of your program file:

#lang eopl
